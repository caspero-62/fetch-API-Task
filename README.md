# fetch-API-Task
This is basically just a solution to Andrei Neagoie's Swapi exercise 
What i did here was just to fetch some set of data from a certain API {Swapi} with JavaScript and style them into cards.
Special thanks to Tania Rascia for her article which helped to put me through and of course, Andrei for his amazing course on web development.
